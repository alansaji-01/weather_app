## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

- **Discord Bot:**  
  There is a known issue where you may see errors like `'int' object has no attribute 'upper'` when using the `!weather` command.  
  This is likely caused by a dependency or the Discord API library, not your code.  
  If you encounter this, make sure your dependencies are up to date:
  ```
  pip install --upgrade discord.py
  ```
  The rest of the project (Telegram bot and Django app) should work as expected.
